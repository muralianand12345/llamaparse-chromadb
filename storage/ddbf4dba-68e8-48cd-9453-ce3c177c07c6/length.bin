o annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s termination of service, but in any case within 90 days following the date of termination of service. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether a Participant has terminated from service and the effective date of such termination.\n---\n## 6.2. In-Service Distribution\n\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement and notwithstanding Section 6.1, a Participant may elect on the Participant’s Deferral Election Form that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant on or as soon as administratively practicable after the in-service distribution date designated by the Participant in the Deferral Election Form; provided, however, that such date is after the third anniversary of the date of the Deferral Election Form, and that if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the in-service distribution date, the Shares shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) on or about the May 16 following the termination of service (or such other date as may be specified by the Administrator in accordance with Section 409A of the Code).\n\n## 6.3. Annual Installments\n\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, after the initial installment of Shares is issued, all subsequent installment of Shares shall be issued in each subsequent calendar year on the anniversary of the date upon which the initial installment of Shares was issued under Section 6.1. Each annual installment shall be calculated by dividing the number of Shares covered by the Deferred RSUs divided by three; provided, however, that if the foregoing would produce fractional Shares, the number of Shares covered under an RSU Award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share and the fractional Share will be accumulated so that the resulting whole Share(s) will be included in the number of Shares covered by the final installment.\n\n## 6.4. Accelerated Issuance Upon Corporate Transaction, Disability, or Death\n\nNotwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction or the Participant’s Disability or death, the Shares underlying all Deferred RSUs shall be issued in a single payment to the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary under Section 6.5, as applicable) as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable event, but in case within 90 days following the applicable event.\n\n## 6.5. Beneficiary\n\nA Participant may designate a beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary in the form and manner specified by the Administrator. Any beneficiary designation hereunder shall remain effective until properly changed or revoked. A beneficiary designation may be changed by the Participant at any time before the Participant’s death by filing a new designation in writing with the Administrator. If the Participant dies without having designated a beneficiary in accordance with this Section 6.5 or if the Participant dies and the beneficiary so designated by the Participant has predeceased the Participant or otherwise ceased to exist, then the Participant’s estate shall be deemed to be the beneficiary.\n\n## 6.6. Vesting and Issuance of Shares\n\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying RSU Awards representing Deferred RSUs shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable issuance date under this Section 6, but no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year containing the applicable
